title: Linux Patch Sumbitted and the Windows Libpack
---

Today I finalized my changes to the FreeCAD distribution for Ubuntu 18.04. I submitted my patch to Launchpad as well. The relevant bugs can be found here:

[LP #1753376](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/freecad/+bug/1753376)\
[LP #1754084](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/freecad/+bug/1754084)

In the mean time I've been working with sgrogan on the Windows configuration. We found some improvements that could be made to the Libpack and a summary can be found [here](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=37807).
