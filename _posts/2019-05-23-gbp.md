Today I went over gbp for FreeCAD.

I booted up my Ubuntu virtual machine and looked through the steps located at: [https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/GitBuildpackage](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/GitBuildpackage)

I'm a bit confused on a few steps so I'll be talking with my mentors to get it done.
