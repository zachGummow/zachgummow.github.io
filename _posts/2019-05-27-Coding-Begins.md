title: Coding Begins
---

The coding period for GSoC 2019 has officially begun.

Using my Debian unstable distribution I stared the packaging process again. I got a lot further in the packaging process but my build returned with some errors.

I will be working with my mentors tomorrow to fix these final issues with my packaging. I'm behind the curve, but I will be contributing bug fixes after I have my environment completely set up.
