title: Incremental Builds
---

Today sgrogan and I went over incremental builds on Windows. By turning off the FREECAD_RELEASE_PDB option in CMake I lose out on some debugging potential but I reduce my total build time.

This will be useful for future builds as I'll need to build often.

I will be having an in-person meeting with kkremitzki tomorrow as he lives close to me. This should help with speeding up our interaction. We also have another in-person meeting planned for this weekend.
