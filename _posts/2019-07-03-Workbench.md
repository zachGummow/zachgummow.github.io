title: Default Workbench
---

I am finishing up the last bit of work in order to create a patch for FreeCAD. The patch will fix an issue with the Start Workbench not working due to Qt4 no longer supporting QtWebkit.

The default workbench will be changed to the Part Workbench, and the Start Workbench will no longer be built.

I've generated a debdiff of my patched installation and the original and will be going through the formal process for submitting the fix.
