title: First Meeting

I had my first meeting for Google Summer of Code. It was between kkremitzki, sgrogan and myself.

It was quite productive and we went over my first initial steps for the project. We settled on doing the following to start:

* Installing Ubuntu 18.04
* Building FreeCAD 
* Building FrecCAD dependencies

During the meeting I was walked through the process of installing the prerequisite software as well as building FreeCAD. I already had an Ubuntu installation through VirtualBox (I primarily use Windows) and this went smoothly other than the fact that I did not allocate enough memory to build FreeCAD. After the meeting was over, I reformatted my virtual machine and built FreeCAD from source successfully.
