title: FreeCAD On Windows
---

I was successful in compiling FreeCAD on my Windows 10 machine. Here is the information regarding my build:

OS: Windows 10 (10.0)  
Word size of OS: 64-bit  
Word size of FreeCAD: 64-bit  
Version: 0.19.16821 (Git)  
Build type: Release  
Branch: master  
Hash: 73c1a9c9a75f1703d79d41d8670f5e073c72c7b5  
Python version: 3.6.8  
Qt version: 5.12.1

There were a few bumps along the way, and I made some mistakes, but sgrogan and kkremitzki got me through smoothly. I can now build and run FreeCAD on both Ubuntu and Windows 10!
